# Concepts of Parallel and Distributed Systems

## Signature Assignment

Project exploring testing concepts and parallel and distributed systems

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing
- Verifies individual components of the system  
- Focuses on testing specific methods or classes in isolation

### Integration Testing
- Checks the interaction between different components  
- Tests combined functionality of methods and classes between two simulated players

### System Testing
- Validates the complete, fully integrated software product  
- Tests the entire system with all simulated players and ensures **Player E** performs as expected
